Canoe Coffee is a fictional Canoe Based Coffee Shop serving boaters in Seattle, WA. The site's mobile-friendly design is for boaters on the go to look up the menu and make reservations.

The front-end is developed with Bootstrap (v5.2) for easy mobile and desktop access and form entry. 

Tools:
    Bootstrap (v5.2)

Development:

My main focus during the initial prototyping was the transition from desktop to mobile. The mobile-first development approach was significant for the intended customer. Utilizing breakpoints, I created a column structure that provided a seamless transition from desktop to mobile devices. I tested my original design with end users with the objective of easy transition from Desktop to Mobile. I found that my left-side navigation didn't transition well to the mobile site during testing. After the feedback, I moved the navigation into a top Navbar component; for the mobile site, the nav links collapsed into a Toggler component. I additionally incorporated the Scrollspy feature into the Nav Bar for quick navigation.
