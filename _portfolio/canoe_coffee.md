Development:

My main focus during the inital prototyping was the transiton from desktop to mobile. Mobile first development was very important for the intended customer. Utalizing breakpoints I was able to create a column structure that provided a seemless transition from desktop to mobile devices. I tested my orignal design with end users with the objective of easy trasition from Desktop to Mobile. During testing I found my original design with left-side navigation didn't trasnsition well to mobile site. After the feedback, I moved the navigation into a top Navbar component, for mobile site the nav links collapses into a Toggler component. Additionally, encorportated the Scrollspy component into the Nav Bar for quick navigtation. 

Initial Prototype
